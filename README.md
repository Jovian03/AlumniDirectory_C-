3.	Need of the Project: - (For students/institutions)
	Alumni serve to be the best legacy carrier in the educational field. The Alumni directory help in exchanging important information with the educational institutions and existing students. 
	The need of the project is to store alumni information in a reliable, convenient manner and building and growing alumni database without much human intervention. 
	The project will act as an interactive and searchable member directory. To keep an open, smooth and good communication channel with the alumni so that they can represent the institutions as brand ambassadors.

4.	Project Description: -
•	In this world of growing technologies, everything has been computerized. With large number of institutions, the alumni network has increased rapidly. Manual handling of alumnus information posed a number of challenges. A number of current systems lack alumni connect for the existing students meaning students are not able to access needful information from their alumnus regarding career and future goals. They are inclined on the faculty members for such information. 
•	There is a need of the system which can handle the data of such large number of alumni in an institution. This product simplifies the task of maintaining records because of its user-friendly nature. This product will maintain alumni information in a file at backend by fully privacy and authority access. The product sets up an interface containing necessary details through a password protected system.
•	A flexible and easy to use alumni solution for institutions & provide modules for personnel information management thereby institutions are able to manage the valuable asset – alumni. This product brings out an easy way of maintaining the details and building a connection with their alumnus. 

4.1	Modules / Functionality: -
•	Login Module – the system provides security feature through username and password matching where only authorized user can access the system. It includes admin and faculty.
•	Admin Module – the admin is the super user of this application. The admin functionalities include adding, listing, modifying and deleting the recording from the database efficiently and with accurate information. He/she will add/search for new record, display detailed list of records for references and make relevant changes as and when required.
•	Search Module – this module lets the user to search different alumni on the basis of the data members associated for easy identification. This is secured since only authenticated user can search based on criteria like unique ID, name, year, email address, department etc.
•	User Module – the user module allows the user to see and get references seamless which are available in the directory. The user can be existing student, faculty, alumni of the institution.

5.	Feasibility Study: -
As we all know that each and every project needs to have a feasibility study for the complete understanding ability of the entire system. 
A project feasibility is a comprehensive report that examines in detail about the system. It is an evaluation of proposed system or project to determine if it 
(1) is technically feasible, 
(2) is feasible within estimated cost 
(3) will be profitable. 

A feasibility study is a primary study that understands before the real work of a project starts to certain the project success. 
•	Economic feasibility: -
The purpose of economic feasibility study is to demonstrate the net benefit of a proposed system for accepting the benefits, taking into consideration the benefits and costs to the agency, other state agencies, and the general public as a whole. 
As my project is Alumni directory, which is very easy to operate and less complicated as compare to any other system. It can be operated by the one having authentication. After verification, the user is able to get into the functionality of the system. 
•	Technical feasibility: -
Technical feasibility is a complete study of the project in terms of input, processes, output, fields, programs and procedures. It is a feasibility that is concerned with specifying equipment and software that will be successfully satisfy the user requirements. 
It directs the technical needs of the system. The project should be developed such that the necessary functions and performance are being achieved. This project is developed with the latest technology. 
My project is made in Net-beans. The interface is user-friendly and easily accessible by the user. 
•	Operational feasibility: -
Operational feasibility is the measure of how a system solves the problem, and take the advantage of different opportunities identified during scope definition and how it satisfies the requirements in the requirements analysis phase of the system development. Operational feasibility is the one that can be used successfully after it has been developed. 
My project is easy to implement and practice in real world. Also, it is very easy to operate after being implemented and I can say that this project is operationally feasible.

6.	System Analysis: -

6.1	Requirement Gathering: -
Requirement gathering is the process of generating a list of requirements from the various stakeholders that will be used as the basis for the requirements definition. Some of the techniques are as follows: 


•	One-to-one interview: -
The most common technique for gathering requirements is to sit down with the client/ customer and ask them what they need.
•	Group interviews: -
Group interviews are similar to one-to-one interviews, except that more than one person is being interviewed – usually two to four. This interview works when everyone is at same level or has the same role.
•	Facilitated sessions: -
In a facilitated session, you bring a larger group (five or more) together for a common reason or purpose. Here we are trying to gather set of common requirements from the group in a faster manner than if you were to interview each of them separately. 
•	Questionnaires: -
Questionnaires are informal, and they are good tools to gather requirements from the stake holders in remote locations. Questionnaires can also be used when you have to gather input from many people.
•	Use cases: -
Use cases are stories that describe how different processes work. The stories include people and describe how the solution will work from the user perspective. Although the use cases may need to be distributed into the more specific detailed requirements. 
•	Brainstorming: -
The solution should be created as a set of ideas which can be agreed by people. After all the ideas are generated, the participants prioritize the ones they think are best for them. The resulting solution of best ideas are used for the initial requirements.

In my project, I will be using one-to-one interviews, use cases and brainstorming for creating an effective database for the user.

6.2	Choice of platform/ Hardware & Software requirement: -

6.2.1	Software used: -
•	Code Interface - Apache NetBeans IDE 16
•	Front End – Java
•	Back End – MySQL

7.	Future Scope & Limitation: -
•	Connecting multiple clients – Currently, the proposed system is limited to one client support. After further enhancements, the software will be able to connect multiple clients and increase the network.
•	Search button: - The user should be able to use search option to find particular information on the software.
•	Profile updating: - The user should be able to modify the existing information without much human intervention.

Although I have put my best efforts to make the software flexible, easy to operate but limitations cannot be avoidable even by us. Some of the product’s limitations are: -
•	Correct user id and password are mandatory for authentication.
•	No outside person from the institution can access the system without permission.
•	Due to constraint of time and resources, the size of the product could not be increased.
•	Due to small scope, the product may not represent the whole spectrum of the employee management system.

8.	Conclusion: -
In this report, an information system’s development has been presented. It was emphasized on the basic steps, consequently taken during the project’s development course as a particular attention was turned to the basic operative functions performed upon the data into the database.
The development of such systems is not just a programming business – a lot of people are ordinarily involved in such projects and one of the basic requirements is the reliability of the system, especially what concerns the storage of data and all of the operations that will be performed upon it.
